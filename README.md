## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

### üîπ Strategies Implemented
Includes several classical and research-backed trading models:
- **Moving Average Crossover** ‚Äì Trend-following logic with configurable short/long windows.  
- **Momentum Strategy** ‚Äì Trades based on directional price persistence.  
- **Mean Reversion (Bollinger Bands)** ‚Äì Volatility-based contrarian model.
- **RSI Strategy** ‚Äì Oscillator-driven entry and exit signals.

Each strategy supports configurable parameters and realistic execution timing (next-bar vs same-bar).

### üîπ Built-In Risk Parameters
One of the Main goals of MTC Trading v1.0 was to design a realistic framwork were it simulates how a disciplined, risk-aware trader would actually manage capital in real markets. MTC Trading v1.0 comes with realistic, industry-aligned risk parameters built in by default. These act as the foundation for position sizing, trade exits, and portfolio exposure, helping keep results meaningful and practical.
- **`max_position_size` (20%)** - Limits any single trade to ensure no single idea dominates risk.
- **`stop_loss_pct ` (5%)** - Automatically exits a position (built-in capital preservation rule).
- **`take_profit_pct ` (15%)** - Locks in gains, maintaining a balanced 3:1 reward-to-risk ratio.
- **`max_portfolio_risk ` (2%)** - Caps total risk exposure per trade, enforcing institutional-style discipline.
- **`trailing_stop_pct ` (10%)** - Adjusts dynamically as price moves in your favor, protecting profits.

### üîπ Risk Management System
The framework includes a dedicated **`RiskManager`** module designed to replicate institutional-style capital management. It controls trade sizing, exit logic, and portfolio exposure, ensuring that every strategy operates under realistic, disciplined risk conditions.

Core Functions:
- **Kelly-inspired sizing** - Dynamically adjusts trade sizes based on portfolio risk and market volatility, balancing potential growth with drawdown control.
- **Stop Loss**, **Take Profit**, and **Trailing Stop** - Execution logic ensures positions are automatically managed to minimize losses and lock in gains.  
- **Maximum Portfolio Exposure** and **Per-Trade Risk** - Caps total open risk to prevent over-leverage and safeguard capital during volatile markets.
- **Detailed event logging** - Tracks all risk triggers and exits, providing full transparency for analysis, debugging, and strategy optimization.

This ensures all strategies operate under controlled, defensible risk conditions.

### üîπ Portfolio Management & Optimization
The **`PortfolioManager`** The PortfolioManager module expands the framework beyond single-asset strategies, enabling multi-asset portfolio simulation and optimization. It integrates several allocation methodologies and diagnostic tools that mirror techniques used in institutional portfolio research.

Core Capabilities:
- **Allocation Models**: Supports multiple weighting schemes, including Equal-Weight, Risk-Parity, Momentum-Weighted, and Market-Cap Weighted portfolios.
- **Optimization Framework**: Implements Mean‚ÄìVariance Optimization (Markowitz model) to explore the trade-off between expected return and portfolio volatility.
- **Correlation & Risk Analysis**: Computes inter-asset correlations and risk contribution diagnostics, helping evaluate diversification effectiveness and asset dependencies. 

By combining these features, MTC Trading v1.0 allows users to construct, test, and analyze portfolios the same way quantitative research teams evaluate strategy combinations enabling the user to balance risk, return, and diversification in a controlled, data-driven manner.

### üîπ Backtesting Engine
The **`TradingBot`** module serves as the core of the framework, executing historical simulations that replicate real-world trading conditions as closely as possible.
It handles trade execution, accounting, and performance tracking across any chosen date range using live market data.

Core Capabilities:
- **Configurable Transaction Costs**: Supports realistic commission and slippage models to simulate trading friction.
- **Execution Modes**: Offers Realistic and Optimistic settings to control for look-ahead bias, ensuring fair backtest results.  
- **Portfolio Accounting**: Tracks cash balances, holdings, and total portfolio value throughout the simulation.
- **Benchmark Comparison**: Automatically computes a Buy & Hold reference for direct performance evaluation.  
- **Comprehensive Trade Logging**: Records every trade with entry and exit dates, reason codes, and holding duration for full transparency.

By combining flexibility with data integrity, MTC Trading v1.0 delivers backtests that are both statistically robust and operationally realistic, bridging the gap between academic research and real-world trading execution.

### üîπ Performance Analytics
The framework provides a comprehensive analytics suite that evaluates both strategy performance and risk-adjusted efficiency.
After each backtest, the system generates detailed metrics and visual reports that allow users to interpret results the same way quantitative researchers analyze real portfolios.

Core Metrics:
- **Return Analysis**: Calculates total, annualized, and benchmark-adjusted returns to measure absolute and relative performance. 
- **Risk Ratios**: Includes Sharpe, Sortino, and Calmar ratios, providing a full view of reward-to-risk efficiency.
- **Volatility & Drawdown**: Reports maximum drawdown, volatility, and recovery periods to assess downside risk.
- **Trade Statistics**: Summarizes win rate, average gain/loss, holding periods, and trade streaks for behavioral insights.  
- **Optional Visual Reports**:
  - **Equity Curve** compared to Buy & Hold benchmark. 
  - **Signal Overlay Charts** displaying strategy entries and exits on price data.
  - **Drawdown Visualization** highlighting risk and recovery phases.
  - **Rolling Sharpe Ratio** to show consistency and performance stability over time.

Together, these analytics make MTC Trading v1.0 a complete research environment. Turning raw backtest results into actionable insights and performance diagnostics that mirror professional portfolio reporting standards.

## üß© Technical Logic

The internal logic of MTC Trading v1.0 follows a clear, modular structure that mirrors how professional backtesting systems operate.
Each component of the framework, from signal generation to risk enforcement, interact systematically to ensure realistic simulations and accurate analytics.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Execution Architecture
The **BacktestConfig** class governs how the system executes trades and manages transaction costs:
- Controls **commission**, **slippage**, and **execution mode** parameters.
- Each strategy outputs a **signal DataFrame** containing buy/sell indicators.
- Execution mode determines when trades occur:
  - *Realistic*: Executes signals on the next bar to prevent look-ahead bias (used for accurate simulations).
  - *Optimistic*: Executes on the same bar for theoretical or comparative testing.

This modular structure ensures consistency between strategy logic and portfolio accounting, keeping results statistically valid.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Position Management
Position sizing and trade execution are driven by portfolio capital, volatility, and defined risk thresholds.
When a signal is generated:
  - The system calculates optimal share size using the `calculate_position_size()` method.  
  - The bot checks capital sufficiency, applying commission and slippage adjustments.
  - Positions are opened or closed based on entry and exit signals, stop-loss triggers, or trailing-stop updates.

By enforcing position limits and capital checks at every step, the framework prevents unrealistic leverage and maintains accurate trade records.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Risk Control Workflow
The **`RiskManager`** continuously monitors all open positions and applies built-in protection mechanisms:
- **Stop-Loss Check**: Exits trades exceeding defined downside thresholds.
- **Take-Profit Check**: Locks in gains once the target percentage is reached.
- **Trailing Stop Update**: Adjusts dynamically with favorable price movements.
- **Risk Event Logging**: Records all triggers with timestamps and reason codes for later analysis.

This ensures that every strategy remains within the framework‚Äôs institutional-grade risk boundaries, maintaining both realism and capital discipline.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Calculation
After each bar (daily interval by default):
- **Portfolio value** is computed as cash + holdings after every iteration.
- **Daily return** = 
   - $$r_t = \frac{V_t - V_{t-1}}{V_{t-1}}$$
   - V*t* = Portfolio value at time *t*
   - *rt*= return on that day
   - $$[r_1, r_2, r_3, \dots, r_T]$$
- **Risk-adjusted** metrics such as Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar ratios, and maximum drawdown are calculated using the time series of returns.
- **Benchmark comparisons** and **trade-level summaries** are generated to evaluate strategy effectiveness relative to Buy & Hold performance.
- **Key statistics**: volatility, Sharpe ratio and Drawdown are updated iteratively.
 
These calculations feed directly into the framework‚Äôs Performance Analytics module, which compiles all metrics and visual reports at the end of the backtest for interpretation and review.
